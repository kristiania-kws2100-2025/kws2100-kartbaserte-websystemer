# Getting ready for the exam in KWS2100 (Geographic Information Systems)

The exam will be 72 hours from May 6 at 10:00 until May 9 10:00. You will get the text of the exam when it starts, but there are several things you can do to prepare.

If you deploy a React application that shows a map on GitHub, you will pass. Grades up to C will require you to
demonstrate specifics that has been shown on the lecture. Grades A and B will require you to deploy with a database by using Heroku and demonstrate features beyond what has been shown in the lectures.

The following will count most heavy towards a good grade: Interactions with the map, styling, finding good data sources and a code structure that makes it easy to add new functionality.

## What data should you use?

You are free to find your own data on the exam. I recommend geonorge.no as a sources, but you can also use
international data that you find.

Datasets that have been used in the lectures and the assignment will give partial credit. Data that is from sources that
I are new to me and data on different formats (WFS, GraphQL, WMS) will be rewarded. As a specific point, using the
GraphQL data source from Entur does NOT count as data from the lecture, and it DOES count as a different format, so this
is a good example for points.

### What functionality could you explore?

Here are some functionality that you can consider examining to get a good grade:

- Clusters
- More interesting Style
- Drawing objects on a map and modifying what you have drawn
- Storing data in localStorage or sessionStorage, especially storing circles
- Vector tile layers with Stadia or Mapbox styles
- Data sources with different format than what we have explored
- Deploying your own GeoJSON og MVT API using Heroku, especially by analyzing data to create a heat map or similar
- Zooming to a selected rectangle on the map
- Overview maps
- Combining background maps with opacity and/or flashlight effects
- Whatever you can think of! Feel free to explore https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/ for ideas

Functionality that has not been covered in the lectures will only be required if you're aiming for an A.

### What help can you get?

I will try and answer questions on mattermost.kristiania.no in the next weeks. I will prioritize answering questions
on the class channel over DMs. I will be unavailable on all forms of communications from the start of the exam until 24
hours after the end of the exam.

You can help each other as much as you want during the preparations. The exam text will describe rules for cooperation
during the exam.

### What about plagiarism?

All software contains reused components and code that's inspired from stack overflow, AI, lectures or other people's code.
I expect similarities between the submissions. Using code from the lectures is not cheating, but extremely similar code
to the lecture code gives partial credit. Plagiarism is to CONSCIOUSLY TRY to give the examiner the impression that you
have created something that you have copied. If you don't think you are plagiarizing code, you are almost certainly
right.
